.
<p>"What is whisky?" asks an evening paper headline. Our memory is
not what is was, but we have certainly seen the name somewhere.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"Bitter," says the <i>K&ouml;lnische Zeitung</i>, "is the taste
of defeat." A reference, presumably, to the thirty thousand tons of
American bacon sold to Germany by the Allies.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"The Octopus," said the Lord Mayor of DUBLIN in his inaugural
address, "is showing its fangs." Meanwhile Cardinal GIBBONS is busy
twisting the Lion's tentacles.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The owner of a mule found wandering at Walton-on-Thames is being
advertised for. "Trooper," writing from Mesopotamia, says that if
it had a portion of khaki breeching and a stirrup in its mouth it
is probably the brute which slipped out of his hands about six
months ago.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>With regard to the man who was seen struggling in the river last
week, the report that his house was immediately taken by a
passer-by is untrue. The man who pushed him in had got there
first.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>So much controversy has been caused by DE VALERA'S escape from
prison that there is some idea of getting him to go back and do it
again.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>It is reported that just before his escape DE VALERA had been
greatly affected by the account of some labour strike. He is
supposed to have come out in sympathy.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>There are now, it is announced, thirty-six prices at which
bottled beer may be sold. It is only fair to our readers to state
that the price it used to be is not included in the thirty-six.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A Servant Girls' Trade Union has been formed. So far there is no
suggestion of interfering with the mistresses' evening out.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Mr. Punch has already called attention to the statement that is
costs the nation a guinea every time a question is asked in
Parliament. The only difference between Westminster and the haunts
of the General Practitioner is that in the latter case (1) you pay
out of your own pocket, and (2) your tongue is protruded instead of
being kept in the cheek.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Burglars are very superstitious, says a press-gossip. For
example the appearance of a policeman while a burglar is drilling a
safe is considered distinctly unlucky.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"The pores of the ordinary individual," says a, weekly paper,
"would reach nearly forty miles if placed end to end." We hope that
nothing of the kind will be attempted, as the traffic difficulties
are bad enough already.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A Thames bargee is reported to have sworn at a policeman for
eleven minutes without stopping. We understand that there is talk
of having the oration set to music.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Considerable damage has been caused in the Isle of Wight by
rats. A description of the offenders has been furnished to the
police.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>In order to cope with the traffic problem the L.G.O. Company
have placed one hundred additional omnibuses on the London streets.
This is such an admirable solution of a serious difficulty that
people are wondering what member of the Government first suggested
it.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Despite the fact that his wife has attempted to shoot him eleven
times a Detroit architect declares that he will never leave her. He
appears to be one of those men who can never take a hint.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Mr. F.M.B. FISHER reports that in New Zealand some convicts
recently went on hunger-strike because a band played outside the
prison. It seems that their ground of complaint was that this was
not included in the sentence.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A correspondent writing to <i>The Daily News</i> points out that
the reign of Satan has been cut short by eighty thousand years, and
that the end of the world is at hand. Several people in search of
flats are now wondering whether it is worth while after all.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Mr. SEAN T.O. KELLY, the Sinn Fein M.P., has handed M.
CLEMENCEAU a copy of the "Declaration of Independence of Ireland."
Other means have also been employed to entertain and amuse the
distinguished invalid during his enforced rest.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>We understand that a West-End lady has just been appointed
mistress to a young parlourmaid.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>We hear that the soldier who, after being demobilised, at once
returned to barracks in order to say a few suitable words to his
late sergeant-major, was put off on being told that he would have
to take his turn in the queue.</p>

<h3>GOOD-BYE TO THE AUXILIARY PATROL.</h3>
<h4>II.&mdash;THE SHIP'S COMPANY.</h4>
<p>Demobilisation in the Navy, whatever it may be in the Army, is a
simple affair. You are first sent for by the Master-at-Arms, who
glares, thrusts papers into your trembling hand and ejects you
violently in the direction of the Demobilising Office. Here they
regard you curiously, stifle a yawn, languidly inspect your papers
and send you to the Paymaster, who, after wandering disconsolately
round the Pay Office, exclaiming pathetically, "I say, hasn't
<i>anyone</i> seen that Mixed Muster book? It must be
<i>somewhere</i>, you know," returns you without thanks to the
D.O., where they tell you to call again in three days' time. On
returning you are provided with a P.I.O. and numerous necessary
papers, requested to sign a few dozen forms, overwhelmed with an
unexpected <i>largesse</i> of pay and sent forth on that
twenty-eight days' leave from which no traveller returns. There's
nothing in it at all; the whole thing only lasts four days. They do
it by a system, I believe.</p>
<p>As we assembled on board for the last time, awaiting our railway
warrants, there were some moving spectacles. The Mate and the
Second-Engineer were bidding each other affectionate and tearful
farewells behind the winch. "You won't quite forget me, Bill, will
yer?" I heard the Second exclaim brokenly, but the only reply was a
strangled sob. The Steward, seated on his kit-bag, was murmuring a
snatch of song that asserted the rather personal fact that "our
gel's a big plump lass." He is an oyster-dredger in civil life and
is eagerly looking forward to experiencing once more the delicate
thrills and excitement of this hazardous sport. Jones, our
Signaller, who recently wrote a poem which opened with the
lines,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"I for one will be surprised</p>
<p>When we are demobilised,"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>was struggling painfully to insert a pair of boots into a
recalcitrant kit-bag, and exhibited an expression of dogged
determination rather than the astonishment he had predicted. The
Trimmer was heard complaining mournfully that when he left the
Patrol Office for the last time they never said good-bye. He seemed
to feel this keenly.</p>
<p>All of us were more or less excited, all as it were on tip-toe
with expectancy, like school-boys on breaking-up morning. All, did
I say? No, there was one member of the crew who sat supremely
indifferent to the prevailing atmosphere of emotion, gazing calmly
before him with his solitary lacklustre eye. The Silent Menace, the
ship's dog, betrayed none of our childlike sentiment.
Demobilisation was nothing to him&mdash;he was too old a campaigner
to let a little matter like that agitate his habitual reserve. To
us the recent period of hostilities had been "The War," the only
war in which we had ever been privileged to fight; but to him it
was just one of the numberless affrays of an adventurous life, and,
judging by the worn condition of his ears and the veteran scars
that tattooed his tail, some of the previous ones had had their
share of frightfulness. And to-morrow, no doubt, he will try the
game again.</p>
<p>It was the Third Hand who suddenly propounded the unsolvable
question: "Who's goin' to keep that there Menace?"</p>
<p>There was an almost universal chorus of "Me!" I say "almost
universal" because Jones, who is R.N.V.R. and educated, probably
said, "I," and the Chief Engineer was lighting his pipe and merely
succeeded in blowing the match out.</p>
<p>"You can't all have him," said the Third Hand, "so I think I'll
take him along with me. I knows a bit about dawgs."</p>
<p>There was instant and clamant disapproval, each one of us urging
an unquestionable claim to the guardianship of the orphan Menace.
The Steward said he was the only one with the ghost of a right to
the dog; had it not always been the Menace's custom to help him
wash up the plates and dishes? A Deck Hand, however, protested that
as he had eaten one of his mittens the Silent Menace was already in
part his property. The Mate and the Second-Engineer nearly came to
blows about it.</p>
<p>The question was still unsettled when the warrants arrived. As
time was short it was finally decided that whomsoever he should
follow was to be adjudged his future owner. We climbed ashore and
spread out fanwise, looking back and uttering those noises best
calculated to incline the unyielding heart of the Menace towards
us. He himself rose from the deck and strolled on to the wharf,
where he stood coolly regarding us. Without emotion his Cyclopean
orb directed its gaze from one to another till, midway between the
Third Hand and the Second-Engineer, it was observed to irradiate a
sudden and unaccustomed luminosity.</p>
<p>"Come along then, Menace," wheedled the Second.</p>
<p>"Yoicks, old dawg!" exclaimed the Third Hand, patting his knee
encouragingly.</p>
<p>But they had misinterpreted their Menace, for in the middle
distance, on a pile of timber directly behind the expectant twain,
had appeared the sleek person of a sandy cat which proved to be the
attraction. For an instant the Menace stood motionless, his spine
bristling and his tail growing stiff; then with a short sharp bark
he sprang forward like an arrow from a bow in the direction of the
feline objective. We saw a streak of yellow as she fled for safety
and life; a cloud of dust, and the Menace and his quarry
disappeared from view. Faintly from afar floated an eager yelp,
telling that the chase was still in full cry.</p>
<p>"Well, sink me," said the Second-Engineer, "that settles
it."</p>
<p>There were trains to be caught, and so, slowly and sadly, we
turned away.</p>
<p>Thus did the Silent Menace, with the rest of his shipmates, bid
good-bye to the Auxiliary Patrol.</p>

<h3>A HOME FROM HOME.</h3>
<p>PRESIDENT WILSON (<i>quitting America in his
Fourteen-League-of-Nations Boots</i>). "IT'S TIME I WAS GETTING
BACK TO A HEMISPHERE WHERE I REALLY <i>AM</i> APPRECIATED."</p>

<h2>THE ROAD TO THE RHINE.</h2>
<h4>A LITTLE LOOT.</h4>
<p>It was at the time when men still imagined that to be a pivotal
man in some way enhanced their chances of being demobilised that an
abnormal wave of acquisitiveness passed over us. Before it passed,
I regret to say, it <i>hovered</i>, chiefly on account of the
prospect of a speedy return home and the desire to take back some
kind of trophy to satisfy the still small voice of inquiry
concerning papa and the Great War.</p>
<p>The very first day after we had arrived in the most unimportant
village imaginable (our usual luck), Roley, the fattest subaltern
on record, lurched into the room and told us of the discovery of a
wonderful trainload of abandoned Bosch material, Being a Regular
soldier, acquisitiveness runs through his whole being, of course,
and he gave us a most glowing account of the wonders to be found.
"Full of things," he cried, "coal, Bosch beds, field-guns and
souvenirs&mdash;hundreds of 'em."</p>
<p>I know no rabbit that could have pricked up his ears quicker
than did the pivotal men at the sound of that magic word. "Hail,
Roley!" we cried; "we who are about to be demobilised salute
you!"</p>
<p>That evening a select conclave of super-scroungers met with
great solemnity. Beds for the men and coal for all&mdash;certainly,
and <i>then</i> we would start collecting. By the morrow each man
slept in luxury, while subalterns from other companies came in to
warm themselves by our roaring fires. Not till then did we feel
justified in turning our thoughts to the furnishing of the baronial
hall at home.</p>
<p>Some day, we pivotal men are still ready to believe, when
demobilisation is nearly complete we shall return to our bowler
hats and civic respectability, but meantime, let me tell you,
respectable elderly subalterns <i>enjoy</i> things like clambering
over a forbidden Bosch train in search of loot. When we had climbed
to the end of the trucks and were thoroughly dirty, we found we had
done very badly. The souvenirs were there all right, but no matter
how interesting and desirable it may be, you simply cannot pack up
a field-gun and send it home&mdash;the tail part does stick out
so.</p>
<p>Chardenal and I had picked up the best thing we could find,
brass cartridge cases (about three feet high) of a 5&middot;9 gun,
and some shorter eight-inch affairs. It was hard work. I carried
four of the former and Chardenal carried two of each, and we looked
as if we had come to mend a main drain. Not having been in the Army
long enough to have lost all sense of shame, Chardenal began by
trying to hide his cases under his British warm. His biggest effort
at concealment was made when passing the sentry of the Brigade
Headquarters' guard, and the noise he made doing it brought the
whole guard out. However, being sentries, they took very little
notice of what we did, except that the N.C.O. in charge certainly
did pick up one of the dropped cases and hand it to Chardenal. This
was after I had tried to help him and we had dropped the whole
lot.</p>
<p>After this Chardenal gave up all idea of concealment and tried
to express by his carriage that he accepted no responsibility
whatever for the souvenirs. He didn't want the things, not he! They
were <i>there</i>, certainly, and&mdash;well, yes, he was carrying
them, but <i>why</i> he was carrying them (here he would have
shrugged his shoulders if he could) he really couldn't tell you; it
was a matter of absolute indifference to him, anyway.
Histrionically I have no doubt it was a great piece of work, but
the only possible inference anybody could have drawn was that he
might have been carrying them to oblige me&mdash;which I
resented.</p>
<p>Heavens, how our arms ached, for it was over two miles to the
billet! A collision of milk-trains could hardly have made more
noise than we did as we clashed and clanged down the main street.
Of course we met everybody we knew. People we hadn't seen for
years, people we didn't like, people who didn't like us&mdash;all
seemed to have been paraded especially for the occasion.</p>
<p>We got home in the end, and it was a great triumph. The only
unenthusiastic person was Mr. Brown, my batman, who surveyed the
things in silence, betokening that he knew quite well he would be
called upon to sew them up in sacking and label them "Officer's
Spare Kit, c/o Cox and Co." Then he looked sadly at my soiled tunic
and my British warm and asked if I had carried them far.</p>
<p>"Over two miles," I replied proudly. "Pity," he said; "there's a
whole dump of them at the bottom of the garden here."</p>
<p>There the matter might have ended if the fat Roley had not
lurched up again the next day with a steel box containing a
dial-sight off a field-gun. The dial-sight was a complicated affair
of prisms and lenses which probably cost the Bosch about sixty
pounds, and we felt a little sick at having overlooked such a
find.</p>
<p>"Awful job I had too," he went on. "Some fellows were seen
yesterday taking stuff away and they've put a sentry on the
train."</p>
<p>"Serve them right," we said.</p>
<p>Next day we returned to the trucks to try again. The sentry was
engaged in a little conversation, and whilst Chardenal took his
photograph (ostensibly for <i>The Daily Snap</i> as "Sentry
Guarding a Train") I slipped behind the trucks, opened a couple of
lids in the tails of some field-guns, picked out two cases of
sights and hurried off. Chardenal joined me later and, concealing
our swag under our British warms, we walked as quickly as we could
until the Brigadier stopped and had a little chat with us about
things in general. And there we had to stand for a quarter of an
hour on a freezing afternoon with two fingers holding the box and
the other fingers holding the coat down to effect better
concealment. Chardenal was in so much pain and wore such an
expression of agonized innocence that the Brigadier wanted him to
come into headquarters until he felt better.</p>
<p>"Well, what have you got?" asked <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page177" id="page177"></a>[pg 177]</span> Carfax, another
candidate for demobilisation, when we finally got back and showed
him the cases.</p>
<p>"Only two?" he cried, "and you promised <i>me</i> one!" We said
things.</p>
<p>"What lenses are they?" he asked.</p>
<p>"I don't know," said Chardenal, "but, whatever's the heaviest
kind, that's the kind we've brought."</p>
<p>And we opened the boxes and they were empty.</p>
<p>The baronial hall will remain unfurnished. I'm fed up with the
whole business.</p>

<h3>THE HOUSE HISTRIONIC.</h3>
<p>The enterprise of Mr. C.B. COCHRAN, who announces that the
oak-parlour used in his play at the St. Martin's Theatre will be
sold by auction at the conclusion of the run, has not unnaturally
provoked a certain liveliness in architectural circles. Should
advertisements of houses for sale ever reappear in the newspapers,
it is thought likely that they may include something like
this:&mdash;</p>
<p>Desirable Family Mansion of unique interest, suit dramatist
seeking congenial associations. Exceptionally fine dining-hall, as
used in the supper scene in <i>Macbeth</i>, and equipped with
convenient <i>Banquo</i> sliding-panel to kitchen. The latter
apartment deserves the epithet Baronial, being transported direct
from the successful pantomime, <i>Puss-in-Boots</i>, and capable of
accommodating a ballet of two hundred cooks. The elegantly
proportioned drawing-room (to which a fourth wall has been since
added) was the subject of special mention in several leading
newspapers after the production of <i>Epigrams</i> at the Niobe
Theatre; while each of the twelve bedrooms represents some recent
triumph in the Problematical Drama. An attractive feature is the
fitting of an artificial sunlight attachment to the outside of each
window; while every room is provided with one or more
telephones.</p>
<p>Snug Bachelor Flat, direct from the phenomenally successful
farce, <i>Peers and Pyjamas</i>, at the Plenipotentiaries Theatre.
The fine central living-room contains sixteen doors, opening into
bedrooms, kitchen, coal-cellar, etc. May be as conveniently entered
by the window as by the doors. All the latter work upon the
well-known dramatic hinge, by which as soon as one shuts another
opens. Unlimited facilities for hide-and-seek. Exceptional
opportunity for active tenant.</p>

circles.</p>

<h3>THE SUBALTERNS' PARADISE.</h3>
<p>I met Bilsden and congratulated him on being in "civvies."</p>
<p>"What are you going to do now?" I asked. "Back to the old
firm?"</p>
<p>"No," said Bilsden gravely; "when a man has acquired the power
of leading men he's thrown away in an accountant's office,
especially as the junior member of the staff. I see no prospect in
England. I have offered to take charge of large departments of
English firms, and be responsible for entire supervision, but they
fail to recognise what the capacity for leadership gained in the
army will do. I'm off to Ceylon&mdash;tea-planting. Just to control
big gangs of coolies and see that they work. It will be child's
play for me. Lovely climate; elephants. An absolutely ideal
job."</p>
<p>It seemed to me on that foggy frosty day, that to lie in a
hammock in the shade, with the temperature about ninety, watching
coolies work, would be the perfect form of labour.</p>
<p>I congratulated Bilsden on having found his
<i>m&eacute;tier</i>.</p>
<p>Half-an-hour later I met Parkinson, another second-loot who had
just shed his pip.</p>
<p>"Well, what are you going to do now?" I asked.</p>
<p>"I'm a bit dubious," he said.</p>
<p>"Try tea-planting in Ceylon," I suggested. "Elephants, spicy
breezes, swing in a hammock all day watching coolies. My dear boy,
were I twenty years younger I should be inquiring about a berth on
the next steamer."</p>
<p>"Ah," said Parkinson, "of course Ceylon's all right, and I've a
lot of pals going out there; but what about rubber-planting in the
Malay Peninsula? They've got tigers there. That's rather a
pull."</p>
<p>I admitted the attraction of tigers to certain tastes, but not
to mine. In my case the pull, I thought, might be on the tiger's
side.</p>
<p>Since these interviews I have been going the rounds of my
military acquaintances and I find a general feeling in favour of
Ceylon or the Malay Peninsula.</p>
<p>Of course it's an excellent thing that they should take up the
white man's burden and make the coolies work, only I'm in dread
lest the overcrowding we suffer from in England may be extended to
the Orient. Will there be enough plantations, coolies and big game
to go round amongst our subalterns?</p>
<p>I can see the Government introducing several Bills&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) For the extension of the Isle of Ceylon;</p>
<p>(2) For the lengthening of the Malay Peninsula;</p>
<p>(3) For the importation of five million coolies, estimated at
the rate of five hundred coolies each, to give employment to ten
thousand second-loots;</p>
<p>(4) For the importation of elephants, tigers, lions, buffalo,
hippopotami, giraffes and capercailzie*.</p>

<h3><i>NOUVELLES DE PARIS.</i></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Paris, March 3rd, 1919.</i></p>
<p>DEAREST POPPY,&mdash;You know, don't you, that I write for the
Press? You <i>must</i> write, <i>ma ch&egrave;re</i>, if you want
to be <i>dans le mouvement</i> nowadays. It's getting to be almost
as big a craze as jazzing and is quite as exciting. It has its
difficulties, of course, but so has the jazz roll. And if you've
got a title or have been mixed up in a <i>cause
c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i> you can write on anything <i>sans aucune
connaissance sp&eacute;ciale</i>. Camilla Blythely says she just
sends in her photo and signature and those obliging newspaper
people do the rest&mdash;which is most helpful to a busy person.
But then we can't all be as notorious as dear Camilla.</p>
<p>I hope it isn't getting just a little overdone. But I hear that
lots of papers are offering only three guineas a column now for
quite important signatures, while others actually insist on
contributors writing their own articles.</p>
<p><i>Quant &agrave; moi</i>, I'm writing up the light side of the
Peace Conference. I do those snappy pars about LLOYD GEORGE'S ties
and CLEMENCEAU'S gloves and all those little domestic touches that
people would much rather read about than such remote things as
Czecho-Slovaks and Jugo-Slavs. I did a most <i>thrilling</i> three
columns about the hats of the delegates, from the bowler of Mr.
BONAR LAW to the "coffieh" and "igal" headdress of EMIR FAISUL, the
Arab Prince. (It's always so effective if you can stick in a word
or two like that that nobody understands. You never need get them
right).</p>
<p>Talking of odd words, the latest <i>boutade</i> over here is to
find new names and epithets for our dress materials&mdash;some of
them quite weird. If you want a silk <i>tricot</i> you ask for
"<i>djersador</i>," while a coarser texture is "<i>djersacier</i>";
"<i>mousseux</i>" now describes velvet as well as champagne;
<i>ninon</i> is known as "<i>vapoureuse"</i>; while to make one of
the newest Spring dresses you require only three-and-a-half yards
of "<i>Salom&eacute;</i>." Some of the <i>couturiers</i> in the Rue
de la Paix are issuing fashion-pronouncing handbooks, while others
have their own interpreters to assist customers.</p>
<p>The theatres over here are getting extremely&mdash;well, what
our grandparents termed "<i>risqu&eacute;s</i>," but it really goes
further than that. And the worst of it is my countrypeople seem to
think it's the smart thing to go to them, which they do most
indiscriminately. <i>Heureusement</i> they don't understand the
stuff. Whenever I see a most circumspect and highly proper British
matron entering one of the Boulevard theatres nowadays I think what
a mercy it is that we as a nation rely so much on pronouncing
phrase-books for acquiring foreign languages. It keeps one so
single-minded in the midst of a wicked world.</p>
<p>But, after all, propriety is a <i>question de
localit&eacute;</i>. Else why do people do things here which would
badly shock us at home? <i>Par exemple</i>, dancing between the
courses of a meal is our latest <i>caprice</i> here; but I was
<i>un peu &eacute;tonn&eacute;e</i>, the other evening, to see the
Duchess of Mintford, at a restaurant of the most <i>chic</i>,
jazzing off the effects of the turbot with light-hearted
<i>abandon</i>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately a waiter carrying a tray darted across the track
at the very moment when she was involved in that step so
<i>embrouillant</i>, the side-roll.</p>
<p>It took quite a long time to collect, and put in their proper
order, the waiter, the contents of the tray, her Grace and all the
other jazzers who were coming up behind.</p>
<p>But, <i>apr&egrave;s tout</i>, little comment was roused because
most of the onlookers thought the incident was just part of the
dance.</p>
<p>So long, old thing.</p>
<p><i>Bien &agrave; vous</i>,</p>
<p>ANNE.</p>

<h3>THE RIGHTS OF LABOUR.</h3>
<p><i>(Extract from "The Times and Mail" of January 1st,
1925.)</i></p>
<p>A significant case was heard yesterday in the courts, when
William Blogg, bricklayer's labourer, recovered twenty-five pounds
damages from James Buskin Carruthers, artist, for injury done to
the plaintiff's eight-cylinder car through defendant's culpable
negligence in allowing himself to be run over by it.</p>
<p>Plaintiff urged that he was a labouring-man, who worked eight
hours a day. The court was at once adjourned, while restoratives
were applied to the Bench.</p>
<p>On the resumption of the proceedings it was explained that since
the passing of the Two Hours Maximum Day Bill the supply of labour
had been inadequate to meet the demands made upon it, and plaintiff
had patriotically filled four posts, at the minimum rate of fifteen
shillings an hour. It was while he was hurrying from one sphere of
activity to another that the collision occurred, resulting in
injury to the plaintiff's mud-guard and loss of valuable time.</p>
<p>Defendant, who admitted negligence, pleaded poverty and threw
himself upon the mercy of the Court.</p>
<p>The Bench, in summing up, called the jury's attention to the
fact that defendant was not a labourer, but only a professional
man; at the same time he reminded them of the impartiality of
British justice, which did not admit that there was one law for the
rich and another for the poor. Even the wealthiest labouring-man
must be protected in the exercise of his inalienable right to
work.</p>
<p>The accompanying photograph shows the plaintiff in the act of
assisting to build a wall.; He is a self-made man, having started
life as a solicitor and by sheer perseverance raised himself to the
lucrative and responsible' position of an unskilled bricklayer's
labourer.</p>

<h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>
<p><i>Monday, February 24th.</i>&mdash;The mantle of the lamented
Mr. JOSEPH KING, whose taste in <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;s</i> was
so remarkable, seems to have descended upon Colonel WEDGWOOD. His
request for the return to this country of LAJPAT RAI, "the Indian
patriot," aroused a storm of objection from other hon. Members, who
considered the description inapplicable to a person deported for
sedition. But it was quickly quelled by the SPEAKER with the
unanswerable assertion that "everybody calls himself a patriot in
these days."</p>
<p>Mr. RAPER sought an assurance that no "wrack"&mdash;which
appears to be a term of art in the timber trade&mdash;should be
used in the houses to be erected under the Government's new housing
scheme. If these were not to be "the unsubstantial fabric of a
vision," he implied, the official builders had better leave the
wrack behind.</p>
<p>Something is at last to be done to reduce the growing plague of
Questions. Hitherto each Member has been entitled to put down eight
Questions for oral reply on any one day. But in future no one is to
be permitted to "star" more than four Questions <i>per diem</i>.
Even that is regarded by some Members as an extravagant allowance.
Major HENNESSY, I understand, thinks "three stars" enough for any
man.</p>
<p>"The Government is not a trustee for one class, but for all,"
was the leading theme of the PRIME MINISTER'S firm and tactful
speech in introducing the Coal Industry Commission Bill. He was
studiously conciliatory to the miners, but made it plain that they
could not be allowed to put a pistol at the head of the general
community.</p>
<p>The miners appear, however, to be in the mood of the little girl
who said, "I don't want to go to bed; I want to be <i>in</i> bed."
The gist of eloquent speeches delivered on their behalf by Mr.
HARTSHORN and Mr. RICHARDS was that the Government already
possessed all the relevant facts, and should give the desired
relief at once. But they mustered only 43 in the Division Lobby
against 257 for the Second Reading.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday, February 25th.</i>&mdash;Their Lordships resumed
their debate on Industrial Unrest. Lord RUSSELL attributed it
mainly to ignorance&mdash;on the part of the capitalists and the
newspapers, who, with few exceptions, never gave fair play to
Labour. He was supported to some extent by His Grace of YORK, who
declared that, after a perusal of the Labour Press and the
non-Labour Press, he could hardly believe they were dealing with
the same subject.</p>
<p>Up to almost the eleventh hour the Committee stage of the Coal
Commission Bill in the Commons was not encouraging. The Labour
representatives moved amendment after amendment, designed either to

MR. BRACE.</b></div>
<p>Mr. RICHARDS moved to omit wages and hours from its purview, but
the House, brought up in the belief that <i>Hamlet</i> without the
<i>Prince of Denmark</i> is but a poor play, voted him down by 270
to 40.</p>
<p>Then came another question-begging amendment from Mr. ADAMSON,
suggesting that the Commission's inquiries into the possibilities
of reorganising the mines should be limited to the single question
of "nationalization"&mdash;the "blessed word" of Labour just now.
This was supported in a capital maiden speech by Mr. SPOOR, an
ex-pitman, whose father and son are both in the mines, and by Mr.
CLYNES, who rather unreasonably complained that the HOME SECRETARY
made SHORTT speeches; but it shared the same fate.</p>
<p>Not till the Bill was nearly through Committee was there any
sign of <i>rapprochement</i>. Then, in response to the persuasive
purring of Mr. BRACE, who had urged that the Commission should
issue an interim report on wages and hours by March 12th, the PRIME
MINISTER declared that, after consultation with Mr. Justice SANKEY,
he was prepared to promise that the report should be ready on March
20th. A smile, extending almost to the extreme limits of his
moustache, spread over Mr. BRACE'S benevolent countenance.
Thenceforward all was peace, and the Third Reading was carried
without a division.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday, February 26th.</i>&mdash;The Lords passed the Coal
Industry Commission Bill through all its stages without a pause.
Then Lord DEVONPORT expatiated on the mistakes of the Food
Controllers with such a wealth of illustration that the LORD
CHANCELLOR, who is fond of Classical "tags," was heard to murmur,
<i>"Omnium consensu capax imperil nisi imperasset."</i></p>
<p>A Second Reading was given to the Re-election of Ministers Bill,
on the plea of the LORD CHANCELLOR that until it is passed several
of his Ministerial colleagues will be <i>nantes in gurgite
vasto</i>&mdash;or, in other words, all at sea.</p>
<p>Rumours that a new Department of Public Information was to be
set up excited much curiosity in the Commons, but only negative
replies were received. The Department, if, and when, it comes into
existence, is not to advertise the virtues of the Coalition, nor is
it to publish a newspaper of its own; though, to judge by the
leaflets, circulars and <i>communiqu&eacute;s</i> issued by the
existing Ministries in the course of the week, such an organ would
certainly not perish for lack of copy.</p>

"" /></a><b>MR. JOYNSON HICKS'S FAIR WARNING TO SIR ERIC
GEDDES.</b></div>
<p>The so-called Ten Minutes' Rule was originally intended for the
introduction of comparatively unimportant Bills. This after-noon
Mr. SHORTT employed it for the purpose of explaining the provisions
of one of the most revolutionary and comprehensive measures
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id="page186"></a>[pg
186]</span> ever brought forward in any country. Briefly it is to
put under the control of a single Minister of Ways and
Communications our railways, our canals, our roads, and also our
supply of electricity, hitherto in the hands of hundreds of public
companies and local authorities. Only on one point did the Bill
meet with opposition. I do not know whether Mr. JOYNSON HICKS
claims any connection with Hicks's Hall, which stands in the old
road-books as the starting-point of the great highway to the North,
but he became almost lyrical in his denunciation of the proposal to
put all the roads in the country in charge of a railwayman like Sir
ERIC GEDDES. They ought, in his opinion, to be under the care of
someone "born on roads" and "trained on roads"&mdash;a sort of
super-tramp, I suppose.</p>
<p><i>Thursday, February 27th.</i>&mdash;To an appeal for an
increase in the pensions of Crimea and Mutiny veterans, to meet the
rise in the cost of living, response was made that such an increase
would be granted in the case of those not over seventy years of
age. It is not thought that the concession will cause a heavy drain
on the national resources, few of the veterans having joined up
before entering their 'teens.</p>
<p>As a retort, "Yah! German!" is, I am told, already considered
<i>vieux jeu</i> by the wits of the pavement. But Ulstermen and
Nationalists still think it effective to twit one another with
having been supplied with rifles from the arsenals of the Bosch.
They bandied charges and contradictions so vigorously this
afternoon that the SPEAKER had to intervene to put an end to these
"nonsensical bickerings."</p>
<p>The SECRETARY OP THE TREASURY scouted the suggestion that County
cricket-matches should be exempted from the entertainment tax. It
is believed that his answer was based solely upon financial
considerations, and that he must not be held to have expressed the
opinion that first-class cricket, as played by certain counties,
<i>is</i>, in point of fact, entertaining.</p>

<h2>THE RED WINE OF THE COUNTRY</h2>
.
<p>"Did I iver tell ye," asked ex-Sergeant O'Reilly, filling his
pipe from my tobacco-jar, "about the red wine?"</p>
<p>"I remember a story about sparkling Burgundy," I said.</p>
<p>"Och, that wouldn't be it at all. 'Twas another time
altogither."</p>
<p>"Well," I said, "tell me about the red wine."</p>
<p>"'Twas this way." O'Reilly leant back in his chair, covered his
maimed hand with a pocket-handkerchief&mdash;a curious way he
had&mdash;and looked at me with that expression of openness and
simplicity which demands confidence. "We was 'way back o' the line
at the time, at a place where ye'd expect to get a taste o' rest;
but what wid fancy attacks an' 'special coorses' (thim 's the divil
an' all!) there wasn't enough rest for an honest man to get into
mischief. Well, there was to be a grand inshpection by a tremenjus
brass-hat, one o' thim soort all over ribbons that rides wid a
shtiff back. 'Twas the mornin' before the great day whin the O.C.
comes to me all of a flutter, an' says he, 'Sergint, ye've a chanct
now to do me a good turn.'</p>
<p>"'I'll do it, Sorr,' says I, 'if it costs me my shtripes.'</p>
<p>"'The fact is,' says he, 'we've run out o' claret, an' there's
no dacent shtuff to be had for twinty miles round; annyway, that's
what I'm tould. Now the Gin'ral has a great fancy for red
wine.'</p>
<p>"''Tis a sad business,' says I.</p>
<p>"'I've heard it whispered,' says the poor man, an' he wid the
D.S.O. an' all, 'that where there's a good dhrop o' dhrink you're
the man to find it. An',' says he, 'there's no discredit to ye in
that, O'Reilly.'</p>
<p>"'Indeed no, Sorr,' says I; ''tis a gift.'</p>
<p>"'Well,' says he, 'would ye use that same gift of yours for the
honour o' the Rig'mint?'"</p>
<p>O'Reilly felt in his pocket for a tobacco-stopper, attended
carefully to his pipe and again fixed me with his candid gaze.</p>
<p>"'There's a bit of a place 'way back,' says I, 'where I've a
fancy I might find somethin'.'</p>
<p>"Wid that he shtuck a bunch o' notes in me hand. 'Don't shpare
the cost,' says he, 'but get it. 'Tis up to you, Sergint, to save a
disp'rit situation.'"</p>
<p>"It was a terrible responsibility," I said.</p>
<p>"Ye may say that. Whin I was alone wid thim notes bulgin' in me
tunic, I'd a notion I might let down the Rig'mint afther all, an'
that would have bruk me heart. But off I wint to see Achille. 'Twas
four miles to the village, an' I wint on my blessed feet, an' by
the time I got to the place I was as nervous as a mouse in a thrap.
Achille's shop wasn't a caf&eacute; or an estaminet or a buvette or
anny o' thim places. He had a bit of a brass plate on his door wid
'Marchand de Vins' on it. I knew him by raison of a fancy that took
me wan day for a dhrop o' brandy. So I wint in through Achille's
door wid thim notes as hot in me pocket as Patsy Donelly's
pipe.</p>
<p>"Achille hopped out o' the little room at the hack same's a bird
out of a cage. 'Ah,' says he, 'that was good cognac, eh? You shall
have more, me son.'</p>
<p>"'Achille,' says I, ''tis a shtrange thing, but there's niver a
thought o' cognac in me mind at all. 'Tis red wine, the best, that
I'm afther.'</p>
<p>"'Red wine!' says he. 'I haven't a litre o' red wine in the
cellars.'</p>
<p>"'Holy Powers!' says I, 'an' you wid "Marchand de Vins" on yer
door.' The shock of it took the breath out o' me entirely. So I sat
up on the counter to think.</p>
<p>"''Tis a matther,' says I, 'that concerns the Rig'mint, a
rig'mint that was niver bate yet.' An' I explained about the
Gin'ral an' what the O.C. tould me. An' thin I tuk the notes from
me pocket an' put thim on the counther undher his eyes.</p>
<p>"'Ach,' says he, ''tisn't money I want from ye, but to hilp a
frind.' Then he folded his arms an' his forehead wint up into a
puzzle o' wrinkles.</p>
<p>"'An' why wouldn't white wine do?' says he.</p>
<p>"'Is it offer white wine to a Gin'ral an' him wid a taste for
red?' says I. 'It might rouse him terrible. Now, Achille,' says I,
'would there be no way of makin' the white red?'"</p>
<p>O'Reilly put a persuasiveness into the last words that revealed
Achille to me as an honest merchant confronted with the most subtle
of temptations.</p>
<p>"O'Reilly," I said, "was that fair?"</p>
<p>"Maybe not, but I'd the Gin'ral an' the honour o' the Rig'mint
fixed in me mind. 'That's a good joke, very good,' says Achille;
but thore was niver a smile on his face.</p>
<p>"'I 'd no intintion to make anny joke,' says I. 'Come, Achille,
you're a knowin' man. Would there be no way at all?'</p>
<p>"Now it happened that he'd lift the door o' the little room
open, an' I could see a bit o' a garden through the window. 'What's
the shtuff growin' out there,' says I, 'wid the dark red leaves to
it, or maybe ye'd call thim purple?'</p>
<p>"'That's beet,' says he with a kind of a groan.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187"></a>[pg
187]</span>
<p>"'Beet,' says I. 'An' isn't beet a red kind of a thing an'
mighty full o' juice?'</p>
<p>"'It is that,' says he, wid the eyes of him almost out o' his
head.</p>
<p>"'Then how would it be,' says I, 'to touch up the white wine wid
some o' that same juice?'</p>
<p>"'The thought was in me mind, God help me,' says he, an' wid
that he sat up on the counther forninst me, an' we shtared into the
garden like two men in a play.</p>
<p>"'Would it make the wine cloudy?' says I.</p>
<p>"'I could filter it so's it'd come as clear as sunshine,' says
he.</p>
<p>"'An' how would it be for taste?' says I.</p>
<p>"Achille put a hand on me arm an' I could feel him shakin' like
a man wid the ague.</p>
<p>"'Heaven forgive me,' says he, 'but ye might say it was the wine
o' the counthry, an' that taste was the mark of it.' 'Tis my belief
he was near cryin', for he was an honest man, an' 'twas for me he
was lowerin' himself to deceit."</p>
<p>"You were a nice pair," I said.</p>
<p>"'Twas a beautiful schame," O'Reilly went on. "I was niver
concerned in a betther."</p>
<p>"Did it come off?" I asked.</p>
<p>"To a turn," said O'Reilly. "We was docthorin' that blissed wine
for the best part o' the day, an' I tuk back a dozen bottles to
camp. The O.C. was hangin' round, as anxious as a dog for his
master.</p>
<p>"'Have ye the wine, O'Reilly?' says he.</p>
<p>"'I have, sorr,' says I; 'but I'd be glad if ye'd ask me no
questions about it.'</p>
<p>"'Not for the world,' says he, givin' me a queer look, an' was
off like a mountain hare."</p>
<p>"Did the General recover?" I asked.</p>
<p>"That wine made a new man of him. He praised the Rig'mint up to
the heighths. We was the pink o' the Army, bedad! The throuble was
he wanted to know where he'd get more o' that same wine.</p>
<p>"'There's no more to be had,' says I to the O.C., for I was done
wid the job.</p>
<p>"'He says it has a powerful bouquet,' says the O.C.</p>
<p>"'That may be,' says I, 'but he'll niver taste the like of it
agin. 'Twas an ould wine o' the counthry, an' there's niver been
the match of it before or since.'</p>
<p>"'Couldn't it be managed annyhow?' says the O.C.</p>
<p>"'Not for all the Gin'rals in the British army,' says I. 'Twas
for the love o' the Rig'mint I got that wine, an' I 'm done wid the
job.'"</p>
<p>"Is that the end?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Barrin' this," said O'Reilly. And he produced from his pocket a
silver cigarette case, inside which was engraved, "To Sergeant
Dennis O'Reilly, who saved the situation, October 15th, 1917."</p>

<h2>THE ART OF LEAVING</h2>
.
<p>If I had a son one of the first things I should teach him would
be the art of leaving. I would have him swift in all ways, but
swiftest when the time came to go. And when he went he should go
absolutely. For although the people who leave slowly are bad
enough, they are as nothing compared with the people who make false
exits and return with afterthoughts.</p>
<p>The other day the necessity came for me to visit a house agent.
Life has these chequered moments. There is something of despatch
and order wanting about most house-agents, possibly the result of
their very odd and difficult business, which is for the greater
part carried on with people who don't know their own minds and
apparently are least likely to take an eligible residence when they
most profess satisfaction with it. Be that as it may, house agents'
offices in general have a want of definiteness unknown to, say,
banks or pawnbrokers'. There is no exact spot for you to stand or
sit; you are unaware as to which of the clerks is going to attend
to you, and the odds are heavy that the one you approach will
transfer you to another. There is also a certain air of familiarity
or friendliness: not, of course, approaching the camaraderie of the
dealer in motor cars, who leans against the wall with his hands in
his pockets and talks to customers through a cigarette; but
something much more human than the attitude of a female clerk in a
post-office.</p>
<p>Being pressed for time and having only the very briefest
transaction to perform, it follows that I was kept waiting for my
turn with "our Mr. Plausible," in whose optimistic hands my affairs
at the moment repose.</p>
<p>Occupying his far too tolerant ear was another client, whose
need was a country house surrounded by enough grass-land for a
small stud farm.</p>
<p>This is what happened (he had, by the way, the only chair at
that desk):&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Our Mr. Plausible (for the fortieth time).</i> I understand
perfectly. A nice house, out-buildings and about twenty acres of
meadow.</p>
<p><i>Client</i>. Twenty to thirty.</p>
<p><i>Our Mr. P</i>. Yes, or thirty.</p>
<p><i>C</i>. You see, what I want is to breed stock&mdash;cattle
and horses too.</p>
<p><i>Our Mr. P</i>. Exactly. Well, the three places I have given
you are all well-adapted.</p>
<p><i>C</i>. When a man gets to my age and has put a little money
by he may just as well take it quietly as not. I don't want a real
farm; I want just a smallish place where I can play at raising
pedigree animals.</p>
<p><i>Our Mr. P</i>. That's just the kind of place I've given you.
The one near Newbury is probably the most suitable. I should see
that first, and then the one near Alton.</p>
<p><i>C</i>. You understand, I don't want a big farm. Anybody else
can have the arable. Just a comfortable house and some meadows;
about twenty acres or even thirty.</p>
<p><i>Our Mr. P</i>. The biggest one I've given you is thirty. The
place near Newbury is twenty-three.</p>
<p><i>C</i>. Well, I'11 go and see them as soon as I can. <i>[Gets
up</i>.</p>
<p><i>Our Mr. P</i>. The sooner the better, I should advise.
There's a great demand for country-houses just now.</p>
<p><i>C.(sitting solidly down again).</i> Ah, yes, but this is
different. What I want is not so much a country-house in the
ordinary meaning of the term as a farm-house, but without
possessing a farm. Just enough buildings and meadow-land to breed a
few shorthorns and a yearling or two. The house must be
comfortable, you know, roomy, but not anything pretentious.
<i>[Gets up again</i>.</p>
<p><i>Our Mr.P.</i> I quite understand. That's just what I've given
you.</p>
<p><i>C. (again seating himself).</i> The whole scheme may be
foolishness. My wife says it is. But <i>(here I believe I groaned
audibly; at any rate all the other clerks looked up)</i> there it
is. When a man has enough to retire on and pay the piper he's
entitled to call the tune; isn't he?</p>
<p><i>[At this point I resist the temptation <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page189" id="page189"></a>[pg 189]</span> to
take him by the shoulders and push him out</i>.</p>
<p><i>Our Mr. P</i>. Quite, quite. Well, Sir, if you take my advice
you'11 go to Newbury as quickly as you can. It's a first-rate
place&mdash;most highly recommended.</p>
<p><i>[Here the client very deliberately puts the three "orders to
view" in his inside pocket and slowly buttons his coat. I flutter
on tiptoe, eager for his chair.</i></p>
<p><i>C</i>. If these won't do you'11 find me some more?</p>
<p><i>Our Mr. P</i>. With pleasure.</p>
<p><i>C</i>. Very well; good morning.</p>
<p><i>[Moves away. I have just begun to speak when he
returns.</i></p>
<p><i>C</i>. Don't forget what I want it for. And not too far from
London or my wife will dislike it.</p>
<p><i>Our Mr. P</i>. Yes, you told me that. I've got a note of it
here.</p>
<p><i>C</i>. And you won't forget about the acreage?</p>
<p><i>Our Mr. P</i>. No."</p>
<p><i>C.(addressing me).</i> I'm afraid I've kept you waiting.</p>
<p><i>I (like the craven liar I am).</i> It's all right.</p>
<p><i>[Client ultimately withdraws, but still with reluctance, and
after two or three hesitations and half-turns back</i>.</p>
<p>And the tragic part of it is that his name is Legion.</p>
<p>That is why if I had a boy I should teach him the art of
leaving. Almost nothing else matters.</p>
<hr />
<h3>OFFICIAL EUPHEMISM.</h3>
<p>DR. ADDISON has stated that for some time past it has been the
practice riot to use the word "pauper" in official documents when
it was possible to use another expression; and no well-conditioned
person will cavil at the spirit which has prompted the use of a
less invidious substitute. But surely the process might be carried
a good deal further. The practice of giving a dog a bad name is not
only condemned by the proverbial philosophy of the ancients but by
the most emancipated of the orthopsychical educationists of
to-day.</p>
<p>If you keep on calling a man a "criminal," you will end by
making him one. How much wiser it would be to refer to the impulses
which occasionally bring him into conflict with the custodians of
law and order as emanating from a dynamic individualism! In that
way you may very possibly convert him into a static individualist
and sterilize his potential malignance by a subliminal
<i>serum.</i>.</p>
<p>The amount of harm done by disparaging nomenclature is
incalculable. Take the word "thief," for example. Its meaning can
be expressed with infinitely greater precision and delicacy in the
phrase, "one who is unable to discriminate between <i>meum</i> and
<i>tuum</i>." Here you have in place of one mean little word a
well-cadenced phrase of ten. Euphony as well as humanity prompts
the variation.</p>
<p>Classical writers may have objected to the use of sesquipedalian
words, but we know better, and Mr. WINSTON CHURCHILL'S famous
synonym for "lie" is permanently enshrined in the annals of
circumlocution. One of the most offensive words in the language is
"idiot"; yet it can be shorn of nearly all its sting when replaced
by the definition, "a person of infra-normal mentality."</p>

<h2>A HARDY ANNUAL</h2>
.
<p>The butler, John Binns, who is an old and faithful retainer to
this household, is now suffering from his annual cough. It is a
terrific cough, capable of disputing supremacy with all other
coughs of which the world has heard. The special points about this
cough are (1) its loudness; (2) its combination of the noises made
by all other coughs; (3) its depth; (4) its shriek of despair as it
trembles and reverberates through the house; (5) its capacity to
repel and annihilate sympathy. It is true that I have interviewed
Binns with regard to his cough&mdash;it is an annual interview and
is expected of me. I have urged him as he values our friendship not
to neglect his cough, and he has assured me in return that the
doctor has prepared for him a draught which possesses the supreme
quality of being absolutely unable to effect the purpose for which
it was devised.</p>
<p>"I shall drink 'is stuff," says Binns, "but I 'aven't any 'opes
of its doing me any good. It doesn't seem to get me <i>be'ind</i>
the eough. If once I could really get be'ind it I should soon
finish it. But yon can't expect to do anything with a cough unless
you're be'ind it."</p>
<p>"Have you tried chloraline?" I venture to suggest, mentioning
not by that name, but by another, a much-advertised specific.</p>
<p>"I've been living on chloraline&mdash;that is when I wasn't
taking camphor lozenges. But my symptoms are too strong for that
kind o' stuff. Besides, I find that it's no use to fill yerself up
with remedies, because they only weigh down the cough unnaturally,
and then when it does bust out it's fit to tear yer throat in
pieces. But none of them get be'ind it&mdash;no, not once."</p>
<p>It will be observed that Binns has almost a superstition in
regard to "getting be'ind." If he got rid of his cough with
everything still in front, he would take no satisfaction whatever
in his malady; but as it is he feels a legitimate pride in it. He
has been a member of this household for forty years, and punctually
on the Kalends of March in every year his cough turns up. It never
reduces his efficiency, but, while it alienates affection, it makes
him more valuable to himself as being one who has symptoms capable
of being related at full length to Mrs. Hankinson, the cook, or to
any of the maids who have not yet experienced it and must be made
aware that they belong to an establishment which has the high merit
of accommodating John Binns's annual cough.</p>
<p>It is something to have a butler who has coughed his
irresistible way through two-and-a-half generations. It is a
perfectly harmless affliction, but it gets on nerves in the same
way as it did when first it huicked and honked and strangled and
choked in the seventies of last century. I can see no decrease in
its vigour or its variety. It deserves the chance of immortality
that I hereby offer it, thus giving it a place beside the cough
that <i>Johnson</i> coughed at <i>Dr. Blimber's</i> famous
establishment. It will be remembered that, when the <i>Doctor</i>
began an excursus on the Romans, <i>Johnson</i>, "who happened to
be drinking and who caught the Doctor's eye glaring at him through
the side of his tumbler, left off so hastily that he was convulsed
for some moments and in the sequel ruined Dr. Blimber's point." He
struggled gallantly, but had in the end to give way to an
overwhelming paroxysm of coughing. It was a good cough, but an
isolated one, and was perhaps, after all, not equal to Binns's.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>
<h4>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks</i>.)</h4>
<p>I SHALL begin by saying straight out that Miss CICELY HAMILTON'S
new book, <i>William&mdash;an Englishman</i> (SKEFFINGTON), is one
of the finest war-stories that anyone has yet given us. You know
already what qualities the author brings to her writing; you may
believe me that she has done nothing more real, more nobly
conceived, and by consequence more moving than this short tale. It
opens, in a style of half-humorous irony, with an account of the
youth, early life and courtship of <i>William</i>, who, with the
girl whom he married, belonged to the vehement circles of the
Labour-Suffragist group, spending a cheerfully ignorant life in a
round of meetings, in hunger-striking and whole-hearted support of
the pacifism that "seeks peace and ensues it by insisting firmly,
and even to blood, that it is the other side's duty to give way."
One small concession you must make to Miss HAMILTON'S plot. It is
improbable that, when such a couple as <i>William</i> and
<i>Griselda</i> left England in July 1914 to take their honeymoon
in a remote valley of the Belgian Ardennes, their friends, knowing
them to be without news and ignorant of all speech save English,
should have made no effort to warn them. But, this granted, the
tragedy that follows becomes inevitable. It is so finely told and
so horrible (the more so for the deliberate restraint of the
telling) that I will say nothing to weaken its effect. From one
scene, however, I cannot withhold my tribute of
admiration&mdash;that in which <i>William</i>, alone,
brokenhearted, and almost crazed with the ruin of everything that
made up his life, creeps home to find his old associates still
glibly echoing the platitudes in which he once believed. A hint
here of insincerity or conscious arrangement would have ruined all;
as it is, the scene holds and haunts one with an impression of
absolute truth, For the end, marked like all by an almost grim
avoidance of sentimentality, I shall only refer you to the book
itself. After reading it you will, I hope, not think me guilty of
exaggeration when I call it, slight though it is, one for which its
author has deserved well of the State.</p>
<hr />
<p>The dominant impression left upon me by Miss MERIEL BUCHANAN'S
<i>Petrograd the City of Trouble</i> (COLLINS) is that its author
is a sportswoman of the first order. You see her pressing to the
windows to observe the shooting in the streets, going out to shop,
to dine, to dance, during the stormy months of the various phases
of the various Russian Revolutions. And I hasten to add, for fear
of misunderstanding, that there is no suggestion of pose as the
heroic Englishwoman. It was not till the end of 1918 that Sir
GEORGE BUCHANAN withdrew from a country in which ambassadorial
functions had obviously no reasonable scope. But he and his family,
including our chronicler, his spirited daughter, remained long
after there was any plausible reason to hope for the restoration of
order and very long after considerations of personal safety might
well have dictated and justified retreat. Mr. HUGH WALPOLE in his
preface points out that Miss BUCHANAN is the first English writer
to give a sense of the atmosphere of Russia during the New Terror.
It is curious, but the impression she conveys is of something far
less formidable than we have imagined. That may well be due to her
high courage which minimised the ever-present dangers. Another odd
impression is that her accounts of current events, <i>e.g.</i> of
the death of RASPUTIN, seem to be as unplausible as those which
have been patched from various reports and guesses by writers far
from the actual scene. It is perhaps the very nearness of the
author to the source of the host of wild rumours and speculations
concerning this strange tragedy that conveys this sense of the
impossible. Have I thereby suggested that the book lacks interest?
On the contrary, it hasn't a dull or insincere page.</p>
<hr />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page192" id="page192"></a>[pg
192]</span>
<p><i>Little Houses</i> (METHUEN) is not, as you might excusably
suppose, a treatise upon the problem of the hour, but a novel. I
confess that, when I read in the puff preliminary that it was
"minutely observed" and "drab" in setting, my heart sank. But Mr.
WODEN'S book is not made after that sufficiently-exploited fashion.
He has a definite scheme, and (but for the fault of creating more
characters than he can conveniently manage) tells his simple tale
with a mature ease remarkable in a first novel. The plan of it is
the life-story of a group of persons in a provincial factory town
in those Victorian days when trade-unions were first starting, when
the caricaturists lived upon Mr. GLADSTONE'S collars and the Irish
Question was very much in the same state as it is to-day. We watch
the hero, <i>John Allday</i>, developing from a Sunday-school
urchin to flourishing owner of his own business and prospective
alderman. Of course I admit that this synopsis does not sound
peculiarly thrilling; also that as a tale it is by now considerably
more than twice told. But I can only repeat that, for those with a
taste for such stories, here is one excellent of its kind. Whether
Mr. WODEN has been drawing upon personal memories for it, writing
in fact that one novel of which every man is said to be capable,
time and the publishing lists will show. I shall certainly be
interested to see. Meanwhile the fact that despite his name
GEORGE&mdash;always an object of the gravest suspicion&mdash;I
accept his masculinity without question is my tribute both to the
balance of his style and to the admirable drawing of his hero.</p>
<hr />
<p>That gallant and heroic gentleman, the late Mr. CECIL
CHESTERTON, proved his quality by his service and death in the
ranks of our army. In such scanty leisure as he could command be
wrote, quite casually as it were, <i>A History of the United
Slates</i> (CHATTO AND WINDUS). He seemed to say as <i>Wemmick</i>
might have said, "Hullo! Here's a nation! Let's write its history,"
which he at once proceeded to do with immense gusto and
considerable accuracy. Americans will not universally agree with
all the views he puts forward. I myself am of opinion (probably
quite wrongly) that I could make a better argumentative case for
the North in the Civil War on the question of slavery. And in his
account of the War of 1812-1814 Mr. CHESTERTON spends a great deal
of indignation over the burning by the British of some public
buildings in Washington, omitting to mention that this was done in
reprisal for the burning by the Americans in the previous year of
the public buildings of Toronto. But in the main this history
brilliantly justifies Mr. CHESTERTON'S courage in undertaking it,
and it is written in a style that carries the reader with it from
first to last. The book is introduced by a moving tribute from Mr.
G.K. CHESTERTON to his dead brother.</p>
<hr />
<p>We doubt whether Mr. BOOTH TARKINGTON'S many admirers on this
side of the Atlantic will read <i>The Magnificent Ambersons</i>
(HODDER AND STOUGHTON) with any great sense of satisfaction.
<i>George Minafer</i> is a spoilt and egotistical cad, and as we
pursue his unpleasant personality from infancy onward our
impatience with the adoring relatives who allow the impossible
little bounder to turn their lives to tragedy becomes more and more
pronounced. In England his "come uppance" would have commenced at
an early age and in the time-honoured place thereunto provided. But
in the case of young American nabobs these corrective agencies are
too often wanting, and though it is hard to believe that a
sophisticated uncle, a soldier grandfather and various other
relatives would have allowed a conceited and overbearing young boor
to wreck his mother's life by separating her from a former
sweetheart, it cannot be said that such cases have not existed or
that the picture is altogether overdrawn. But we do not like
<i>George Minafer</i>, and his final reconciliation with his own
sweetheart and her father&mdash;the man whom ho has prevented his
mother from marrying&mdash;leaves us cold. But if the characters
are unpleasing the craftsmanship of <i>The Magnificent
Ambersons</i> is of Mr. BOOTH TARKINGTON'S best, and his
description "of the decline and fall of a locally supreme dynasty
of plutocrats before the hosts of the Goths and Huns of spawning
industrialism is almost a contribution to American social
history.</p>

<hr />
<p>Of the two tales in <i>Wild Youth and Another</i> (HUTCHINSON) I
prefer the other. In "Wild Youth" Sir GILBERT PARKER gives us the
unedifying picture of a horrible old man married to a young and
pretty girl. Jealous, tyrannical and vicious, this
creature&mdash;referred to as a behemoth&mdash;is in all conscience
unsavoury enough; but no one can read his story without feeling
that he never had a dog's chance; and although the tale is in many
respects well-told, I feel that it would have been vastly improved
if some redeeming qualities had been vouchsafed to the villain of
the piece. "Jordan is a Hard Road" is a more engaging piece of
work. Here we have a man who has walked through most of the
commandments&mdash;with especial attention to the
eighth&mdash;trying to mend his ways. And he makes rather a sound
job of it until something quite unforeseen happens; and then the
old Adam (if this is quite fair to Adam) asserts himself. From a
publisher's "literary note" enclosed in this book you will learn
that Sir GILBERT'S imagination is "as boundless as the tracts of
the Prairie which he loves and knows how to make his readers love."
This is perhaps rather a large order, but I will content myself by
saying that for the scenes of these stories Sir GILBERT has chosen
ground that is familiar to him, and that knowledge is sometimes
even more useful than imagination.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
